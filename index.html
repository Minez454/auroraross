        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Aurora Ross. I am a cybersecurity student at Strayer University, and I'm based in Las Vegas.  I have maintained a 4.0 GPA for three consective years because I am driven to succedd in this field.  
        
        My background is in the U.S.Army as a Unit Supply Specialist. That experience taught me meticulous attention to detail and how to manage offical logistics, which are skills I am now applying directl to a career in technology.
        
        I am particularly interested in s=network security and Python, and I spend my free time building hands-on projects with my Rasberry Pis. I am actively seeding a role where I can apply my discipline and technical skills to help solve real-world security challenges.</p>
